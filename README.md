# TITOUAN-CHESNEAU
This is my professional repository

In order to test my projects, you have to run the executable by a simple command.
"./executable_name map" for Sokoban and BSQ.
For Dante_Star, you have to give the executable the size you want for your maze.
For example :
"./generator/generator x y > map.txt"
and "./solver/solver map.txt"
And there you go, have fun with my projects !
